## 2. Activity Cards: 

Instead of Photos and Reels, users share Activity cards in this social media.
They are able to create their own activity cards, which include a topic and a description and a limit on how many users can participate.
Each Activity card represents a certain room with a certain topic. 
Other users can join these rooms and start studying in a group.
